    <p> <!--paragraph-->
      Experience  life through the eyes of a person who was surrounded by 
      darkness from the very beginning. Every “day” in the book is about 
      the phases we go through at least once in our lives. It is a series
      which the author expresses through illustrations and art. It is for
      people who love to let their imagination run wild. Ecstasy will also
      inspire people, who don’t usually read books, to start reading.

    <h2>Ecstasy 165 Days - An Eternal Obsession</h2>
    <p>It's been three years since the last time we met. Tell me, isn't it 
      beautiful to find a person who gives so much love and care to every part 
      of you? A person who knows your happiness, sadness, wounds, and scars.
      A person who helps you make peace with your past, present, and future.
      A person who understands your pain, agony, and depression. Tell me, 
      isn’t it beautiful to have such a person in your life? When was the 
      last time someone gave absolute attention to every detail about you?
      Perhaps this is why we were destined to meet each other.

      Welcome back to my dark world once again. I’m going to show you something
      you’ve never, ever seen before because this time . . . I'm going to
      leave my fingerprints in your soul.
